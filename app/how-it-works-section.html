                Fish in a tank produce waste, which is high in ammonia, and very toxic to fish. However, the waste water
                is pumped from the fish tanks, through a small filter, and into the growbed. In the growbed bacteria
                convert the ammonia into nitrite, followed by another strain of bacteria which convert the nitrites into
                nitrates.
                <sup id="how-it-works-citation-1">3</sup>
                The nitrates are taken up by the plants as fertilizer. This process, meanwhile, cleans the water from the
                harmful ammonia compounds for the fish and the clean water is returned to the fish tanks.

                This completes a full cycle of water through the system. The chemical balance of the system is a
                little tricky to get started, getting the pH levels balanced and the dissolved oxygen levels high enough
                for the fish to survive are probably the most challenging aspects of aquaponics. Several other problems
                can also occur such as algae growth, lack of essential bacteria, and swings in temperature or
                sunlight

                . However, once stabilized, the system can theoretically run forever with the necessary inputs.
