                UT Aquaponics started in Fall 2014 when two members of
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Engineers-for-a-Sustainable-World-University-of-Texas-at-Austin-Chapter-388428151204053/">Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW)</a>
                , Nicholas Phillips and Alina Dale Lapotin submitted a proposal to the
                <a href="https://sustainability.utexas.edu/greenfee.php">Green Fee Committee</a>
                for permission and funding to build an aquaponics system. They wanted the system to include sensors that
                could monitor key parameters and alert the system operator when something needs fixing. For example, the
                system should be designed to alert when the pH is too low, or if the water is too high. The goal of this
                project was to educate the UT community about the technology of aquaponics by letting students work
                collaboratively to design, build, and operate an aquaponics system.

                In Fall 2015, a small team of students from ESW started gathering materials and finalizing the
                design of the system. With the help of faculty adviser Delia Brownson, they found a home for UT
                Aquaponics in the painter greenhouse, and decided to build two different types of systems: a
                floating raft system and a media bed system. Now, after nearly one year of work, the media bed
                system is home to 10 happy goldfish and a thriving crop of chard, and the floating raft system
                has been completely assembled and will begin producing Summer 2016. On May 5, 2014, UT
                Aquaponics sold their first harvest of chard at the
                <a href="https://utmicrofarm.wordpress.com/">UT Farm Stand</a>
                , and starting in Fall 2016 the systems will be featured as a part of the
                <a href="http://www.utgreentours.com/signups.html">UT Green Tour</a>
                .
